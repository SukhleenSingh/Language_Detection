# Language_Detection
Techstack - Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Jupyter Notebook, Python
1. Use Scikit-learn for implementing the Multinomial Naïve Bayes algorithm, and NLTK for language processing
tasks.
2. Enabled users to identify languages from text, facilitating language-specific analysis.
3. The dataset used contains 22 languages, each with 1000 sentences.
4. The Multinomial Naïve Bayes algorithm is chosen for multiclass classification in language detection.
5. The model's performance is briefly mentioned, with a note that it can identify languages only from the dataset provided.
