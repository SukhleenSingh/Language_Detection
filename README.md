# Language_Detection

Overview
Welcome to the Multilingual Language Detection project repository! This project focuses on enabling users to identify languages from text using machine learning techniques. The application utilizes the Multinomial Naïve Bayes algorithm for multiclass classification implemented with Scikit-learn. Additionally, NLTK is leveraged for language processing tasks, enhancing the accuracy of language detection.
